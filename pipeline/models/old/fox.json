The task_descriptions should each be a string that clearly instructs one of our research analysts on what we need. Each Task Description should be clear, focused, and stand on its own, without depending on other tasks. Tasks should be scoped so that each task can be completed by a research analyst working alone, without the need to consult with other researchers or the PM. Your plan should contain between 4 and 8 tasks depending on the complexity of the project\n\n---\n\nPROJECT IDEA: {userRequest}"
